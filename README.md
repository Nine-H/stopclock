#Stopclock
the only clock app that's right twice a day!

###about
stopclock is one of those tools that just should have been built in, but I'm glad it wasn't because I plan to make hot $$$ flogging it in appcenter. 

###features

####stopwatch
* starting
* stopping
* lap function

####countdown timer
* hahahaha

####alarmclock
* dummy

####reminder
* great if you want to stretch every 20mins otherwise it pops a useless notification :D

####world clock
* dummy

###get it
I'll write this when it's worth having

if you figure it out and see missing icons fix them with

```
sudo update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/*

```

###you made it this far :D
Amateur apps cop alot of stick for only really scratching the developer's itch, I can't think of an app this describes more thoroughly than this one. So far StopClock has doubled my plank time, improved my posture, and taught me github and vala.

Started on luna, stopwatch icon from sysprof from the gnome team, first program for linux, really bad but a learning experience, please help out if you can.
